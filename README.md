Tool to generate typescript definitions for garrysmod.

For use with https://github.com/Perryvw/TypescriptToLua

The first run will take a while because all pages need to get fetched from the gmod wiki.
Executions after that shouldnt take longer than a couple of seconds.

Caches wiki pages into projectroot/wikiData
and generates declarations in projectroot/out

If you want to refresh your cache just delete the wikiData folder and rerun.

### Why isn't index.d.ts generated by travis?

Generating index.d.ts on the CI would require a lot of webrequests. Which is really slow and could violate Travis TOS. Releases are created locally for now and published via travis/github releases.
